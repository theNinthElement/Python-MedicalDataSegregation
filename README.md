# Python-MedicalDataSegregation

Here we create a high level Metadata file which has a record of the number of objects that were captured/registered. 

The folder structure is such that all the related objects are grouped together in one folder and are further divided into folders which are named on the dates they were captured/created.

The files names are converted into the data they provide i.e. an org_data/automobile/2022-08-3/image.jpg contains the image of the automobile captured on 2022-08-03 and org_data/automobile/2022-08-3/segementaion.csv contains the segementations details for the same object.  

All the images/photos are maintaned to jpg images. 
All objects are in txt fotmat.
All histogram data are in tsv format. 
Segmentation data is in gif format. 
Statistics data is in csv format.
